# Python fuzzing samples

## About

This repository contains several samples of fuzzing-testing using Python library - Frelatage. Tested libraries are:

- validators: [link](https://github.com/python-validators/validators);

- AdvancedHTMLParser: [link](https://github.com/kata198/AdvancedHTMLParser).

There were two types of fuzzing used:

- Default fuzzing: based on finding errors and single bugs;

- Differential fuzzing: based on comparing multiple implementations of some functionality and aimed at spotting incorrect answers.

## Launch

In order to launch test you need to:

1. Install requirements from file `requirements.txt` via `pip`:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Launch any chosen `test.py` file from project:

    ```
    python test.py 
    ```

As soon as fuzzing is complete (or manually stopped) directories with output files can be found in the root directory where launched file `test.py` is situated. Those are such directories:

- `cov`: directory which stores files with inputs generated by Frelatage fuzzer during process of testing - these inputs covered tested functionality;

- `out`: directory which stores files with information about errors which occurred during process of testing.
